## Getting Started

### Font

I'm using [jetbrain mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) as my primary font. It's free and really awesome.

### Setting Up

Clone the repo


```
cd ~
git clone --recursive https://github.com/tnb24/dotfiles 
cd dotfiles
```

Download zsh

```
sudo apt-get install zsh
```

:warning: Only run the scripts if you know what you're doing :warning:

Run ```sh init.sh```. After that ```sh sync.sh``` and if you want the same vsc extensions as mine run ```sh vsc.zsh```


## Finishing Up

Get some fried chicken and feel happy about your life and your dotfiles
